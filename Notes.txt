python program

1=write a function to multiply all the number in a list.
2=write a program to reverse a string.
3=write a program to claculate a factorial of a number which is a non negative integer by using a function the function accept a number as an argument.
4=write a program to get a string made of the first two and the last two character of a given string.if the string length is less then two return the empty string.
5=write a program to add ing in at the end of given string if the length is atlest 3.
(i)if the given string alredy end with ing and place ly in place of it.
(ii)if the string lenghth of the given string is less then 3 leave it unchanged

UNIT 4

file pointer

1. tell()

Syntax-- file_obj.tell()

ab=open("location.txt","r")


the tell function identifies the current postion of the pointer that means from where the pointer will start to read when the reading operation is perform.

2. seek()
this function is used to change the pointer position and it will move the pointer to the bite value thet we pass to it.
Syntax-

print(ab.readline())
print(ab.tell())
ab.seek(6)
print(ab.read(5))
ab.close

questions

1. wapp to find the longest word in the file and get the file name from the user.
2. wapp to read and print each line from any file of your choice use in readline function.
3. wapp to count the total number of uppercase leter and lowercase and digit used in the given text file(creat your own text file).
4. wapp to reverse each word in a file.

Modules and Packages

MODULES-->

they are general python file that conatain a set of functions classes,and methods.
each domain has it own function who to achieve an output

Advantages-

1. reusebality-modules once created can be called with in another piece of program to perform any operation.
2. easy to use -it ideally focus on achieving or solving a part of a biger problem.
3. scope - in a piece of program a programmer can called multiple modules.


built in modules 
1. math
2. cmath
3. Decimal
4. random
5. statistics

23jan2024:

Packages::

A package in python is a folder where we can have multiple number of python file. it should contain a file with a name (_init_.py). It menas that 
the folder in the file system which contain this file will we consider as package.

Creating a package::

1. we need to creat a directory and give it a suitable name matching with the function that we are going to perform with the package.
2. once the directory is created we can add multiple modules 
3. now creat a file (_init_.py) in order to make python understand that it is a package. This file can we empty or it can contain some code as well.

___________________________________________________________________________________________


NUMPY::

->it stand for numeric python it is a python library used for working with arrays.
->in NUMPY the array size is fixed and once created it can not be modify.
->function perform with NUMPY are 

1. mathematical and logical operation
2. foriour transform
3. linear algebric operation
4. random number generation

Syntax::

import numpy as np

array_one = np.array([10,11,12])
array_two = np.array([1,2,3],[4,5,6])

print(array_one)
print(array_two)

print(type(array_two))
print(array_two.ndm) #dimension
print(array_two.size)
print(array_two.dtype)
print(array_two.nbytes)



question::

Q 1. Using numpy module take 2 arrays and input 5 elements each. Now perform basic operation such as::
1. add 5 in each element of the array 1
2. multiply 10 with each element of array 2
3. sum of all array element of array 1 
4. sum of both the array element
5. Calculate the largest element in array in array 1 and smallest element in array 2.

Q 2. Create a program to reverse a numpy array 
Q 3. create a program to check whether the numpy array contain a specified row.

Scipy:-
-------
    it is an open source package that can be use freely it is a lib that stands for scientefic python and provides more mathematcial operation with numpy underneath. scipy has optimise functions that are frequinty use in numpy and data science.

Pandas:-
--------
    It is lib use for working with data sets it is an open source python library that provides functions for high performance data analyising cleanig, exploring and manipulation using its powerfull data structures.

series:
--------
    it is a 1d array structutes define in pandas which can be visualised as a colomn in excell sheet it has index values as the axis labels and can be us to store data of any type inclusing string, integer, float and python object.

Data frames:-
-------------
    It is a 2d structure that consist of rows and column and use to store any type of data.
___________________________________________________________________________________________

Tkinter:-
---------
-> It is a standard library for creating the graphical user interphase for desktop based applications.

-> Steps to create a Tkinter top level window :-

1. Import the Tkinter modulue
2. Create the application window 
3. Add the widgets like labels,buttons and frames to the window 
4. Call that main event loop so that the actions that can take place on the users computer screens.

Tkinter widgets:
1. Buttons
2. Canvas
3. CheckButtons
4. Entry 
5. Frame
6. labels
7. Listbox
8. Menubuttons
9. Menu 
10. Message
11. Radio button
12. SCale 
13 Scrollbar
14. Text 
15. Toplevel
16. Spinbox
17. Labelframe
18. Messagebox
19. Pankedwindow


Python Tkinter Geometery:- 
--------------------------
The tkinter geometry works on three diferrent methods:-


1. The Pack Method:- It is use to organise any widgets in a block.

   Syntax:- Widgets.pack( options )

    i. Expand:- if the expand options is said to be true the widgets expands to fill any space.
    ii. Fill:- by default the fill is set to none, however we can set it to x or y to determine wehter the widget contais any extra space 
    iii. size:- it represent the size of the parents to which the widgets is to place on the window.

eg >

parent = Tk()
redbutton = Button(parent,text="Red",fg="red")
redbutton.pack(side=LEFT)
blackbutton = Button(parent, text="Black",fg="Black")
blackbutton.pack(side=RIGHT)
parent.mainloop()
